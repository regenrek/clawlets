# Clawdlets

Clawdlets is the hetzner infrastructure companion for [clawdbot](https://github.com/clawdbot/clawdbot) and [nix-clawdbot](https://github.com/clawdbot/nix-clawdbot). It provides the tooling to deploy and manage secure, reproducible bot fleets on Hetzner Cloud using NixOS. We simply handle the deployment plumbing for these core products.

## Features

- **Discord bot fleet** – deploy multiple bots from one repo.
- **Secure by default** – WireGuard/Tailscale, lockdown, sops/age secrets.
- **Hetzner + NixOS** – immutable infra + reproducible deploys.
- **CLI-first** – bootstrap, deploy, ops, troubleshooting.
- **Atomic updates** – rollbacks via NixOS generations.

## Quickstart

## Ask an agent (copy/paste prompt)

```text
Goal: deploy a fresh Hetzner server with this repo (no leaked secrets).

Constraints:
- do not commit any instance data; keep everything in .clawdlets/ (gitignored)
- do not run live actions unless I confirm (bootstrap/lockdown/terraform apply)
- no shims/workarounds; fix root cause; single source of truth

What I want:
1) exact local commands (macOS) for: pnpm install, clawdlets stack init, clawdlets secrets init, doctor
2) exact deploy steps: infra apply -> bootstrap -> connect via Tailscale -> lockdown
3) exact ops commands: server status/logs/restart; rebuild pinned by full git SHA
4) if something fails: ask for the exact error output and propose the next command

Start by reading docs/README.md, then tell me the minimal command sequence for one host.
```
