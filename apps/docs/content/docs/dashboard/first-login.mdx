After Convex is wired, the first dashboard session establishes your project and
connects it to a local repo.

## 1) Sign in

Open the dashboard (local dev: `http://localhost:3000`) and sign in using the configured
Better Auth provider.

**First user becomes admin.** The first account to sign in is promoted to `admin`.
Subsequent users default to `viewer` unless promoted by an admin.

## 2) Create a project

From the Projects screen, create a new project and point it at your local repo. The
template source defaults to `config/template-source.json`, which the dashboard uses
to discover the starter files and expected layout.

1. Create a new project.
2. Configure the repo root and template source (defaults to `config/template-source.json`).
3. Wait for the project init run to finish.
4. Continue to **Setup** (the dashboard redirects there automatically).

## 3) Run through Setup

Setup is a Vercel-style command center for the first deploy. It is derived from real
state (config, secrets, local deploy creds, and runs), so you can close it and resume
later. After host setup completes, continue with OpenClaw setup for gateway/app wiring.

First step is **Connect Runner**. Setup now creates a runner token inline and gives
you the exact command to run locally. Remaining steps stay locked until runner
connection and repo probe are green. See [Runner Agent](/operations/runner-agent).
