<Callout type="warning" title="Experimental">
  AWS support is experimental. It is not the recommended production path today.
  Scope may change, and full parity with Hetzner may never be delivered.
</Callout>

AWS support currently centers on image/AMI workflows. If you need predictable
production behavior, use [Hetzner](/providers/hetzner).

## Current state

- Supported direction: image/AMI-oriented bootstrap path.
- Not documented as a fully supported production baseline.
- Behavior and required fields may change as support evolves.

## What exists today

- Provider config keys under `hosts.<host>.aws.*`
- Deploy credentials via `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- Image publish/import path used for bootstrap mode image

## Known operator risks

- Gaps may exist in parity with Hetzner docs and runbooks.
- Failure modes may require manual recovery patterns.
- Changes to workflow/flags are likely while support matures.

## Recommended usage

- Use only for experimentation or development evaluation.
- Keep rollback path to Hetzner when reliability is required.
