title: Architecture Roadmap
description: How the spine + provider plans fit together.
---

This roadmap links the two execution plans that define the refactor order and provider policy.

## Plans

- Plan A (spine): domain split + contracts + lifecycle gating
- Plan B (providers): provider drivers + provisioning workflows

Paths (internal):
```
/Users/kregenrek/projects/clawlets-mono/.cursor/plans/clawlets_greenfield_architecture_3bcb927c.plan.md
/Users/kregenrek/projects/clawlets-mono/.cursor/plans/cloud_provider_drivers_62438276.plan.md
```

## Dependency

Plan B starts only after these Plan A milestones exist:
- SecretsPlan scopes contract (bootstrap/updates/openclaw)
- Lifecycle gating (`hosts.<host>.openclaw.enable` + scoped secrets verify/init)
- Core/CLI domain boundaries (at least within `packages/core` + CLI commands)

## Provider Policy

- Hetzner: Phase 1 (nixos-anywhere) is required.
- AWS: Phase 2-first (image/AMI pipeline). Keep Phase 1 out of scope unless it becomes required.

## Execution Order (Summary)

1. Plan A foundations
2. Plan B provider drivers (Hetzner + AWS Phase 2)
3. Optional: AWS Phase 1 later if required
